# Stashes

A simple tool to stash all those "very important" tabs you'll definitely need in the future and keep them safe in the cloud.

## Brief History

This thing started a really long time ago as a simple webapp to learn Lisp and be able to access my tabs from Chrome on devices that did not have this ability, like my BlackBerry Playbook (I know, I know...), but I never finished it and it just sat in my drive gathering dust for years until I bought a new laptop with less RAM (went from 32GB to 16GB and now 12GB), so I decided I needed to educate myself to close some tabs in Chrome since it was usually using almost 10GB of RAM.

Since I didn't want to loose these extremely important tabs forever I decided I needed something to fix this problem. I looked into [TooManyTabs](http://www.visibotech.com/TMTChrome), but really hated the UI, then I noticed [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/), which was literally the thing I was looking for, but sadly it stored its data in localStorage and didn't have a way to backup the data automatically, I had to manually back it up myself by exporting the data which is something I would eventually forget to do and loose all my tabs eventually. So after all this I decided I **had** to create yet another tool for this and chose this repo as my starting point.
